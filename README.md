# SoME Topics

Do you have an interesting, mathy idea that you would like to share with the world?
Are you really good at animating, but do not know what type of content to make?
Are you looking to be inspired or else find a group of people working on interesting projects?

Well, you have come to the right place!

This github repository is meant to help facilitate discussion between people for the Summer of Math Exposition (SoME) competition.
Note that there will be no files in the repository itself.
Instead, we will be using github issues to create and maintain discussion threads.
Here, I will briefly cover any questions you might have regarding the collaboration process.

## Do I *need* to use github?

No! Not at all, if you can organically find people through other methods (discord, e-mail, the ArXiv, etc), then this repository is not necessary at all!
This repository is meant to provide a quick list of projects that are looking for collaborators.

## Why github?

Honestly, because it has all the tools we need without having to reinvent the wheel.
Simply put, we wanted a way for people to create and maintain discussion threads.
Though that is definitely possible on discord, slack, reddit, and plenty of other social media platforms, github was designed for various types of technical discussions and should be a good fit for our purposes.

## How do I start a discussion thread for my topic?

Go to [Issues](https://github.com/leios/SoME_Topics/issues) and create a new one.
Once you have a group together or are otherwise no longer looking for collaborators, please close the issue!

## How do I find available topics?

Go to [Issues](https://github.com/leios/SoME_Topics/issues) and find a topic that interests you.
Note that there could be several pages of topics to discuss!

## How do I follow discussions on github?

The easiest way is to click the "Subscribe" bell on the right of each issue.
Depending on your user settings, github should send e-mails to you automatically for participating discussions.

## What if I would like people to contact me off of github?

No problem!
Please put your preferred method of communication in the github issue for your topic.
If you would like to chat on discord, please include your name and associated user tag (which can be found by looking at the bottom left of the discord window).

## How do I add math / LaTeX to github issues?

Github has mathjax support, so feel free to just use mathjax like normal!
It *should* work in most cases.

If you have further questions, please let me know and I'll add them to the list here!
