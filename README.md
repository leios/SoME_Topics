# SoME Topics

This repository is a space for coordinating collaborations between people interested in producing online math explainers, with a focus on the Summer of Math Exposition (SoME).
In particular, the aim is to play match-maker between two kinds of people:

1. Professors, teachers, or anyone else with domain expertise and ideas for what would make a great piece of math exposition, but who may not have the time and content production know-how to fully bring the idea to fruition.
2. Those interested in content production, whether that means video editing, animation, producing interactive blog posts, or whatever else.

[This video](https://youtu.be/ycpmMnO3-Uk) offers a nice example of the kind of collaboration which inspired us to organize this kind of match-making, where the mathematician Richard Borcherds has a very lovely lecture about the Leech lattice, which Lyam Boylan helps bring to life through visualizations of the topic.
The entire channel [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/c/numberphile) also exeplifies this kind of collaboration.
Keep in mind, though, collaborations don't necessarily have to be videos.

Note that there will be no files in the repository itself.
Instead, we will be using github issues to create and maintain discussion threads.
Here's how it will work.

## How do I start a discussion thread to seek a collaborator?

- Go to [Issues](https://github.com/leios/SoME_Topics/issues) and create a new one.
- Choose either "Topic seeking a producer" or "Producer seeking a topic", and fill out the corresponding template including any relevant links or information to help people know what you are looking for.
- Once you have a group together or are otherwise no longer looking for collaborators, please close the issue!

## How do I find open collaboration requests?

Go to [Issues](https://github.com/leios/SoME_Topics/issues) and find a topic that interests you.
Note that there could be several pages of topics to discuss!

## How do I follow discussions on github?

The easiest way is to click the "Subscribe" bell on the right of each issue.
Depending on your user settings, github should send e-mails to you automatically for participating discussions.

## What if I would like people to contact me off of github?

No problem!
Please put your preferred method of communication in the github issue for your topic.
If you would like to chat on discord, please include your name and associated user tag (which can be found by looking at the bottom left of the discord window).

## Do I *need* to use github?

No! Not at all, if you can organically find people through other methods (discord, e-mail, the ArXiv, etc), then this repository is not necessary at all!
This repository is meant to provide a quick list of projects that are looking for collaborators.

## Why github?

Honestly, because it has all the tools we need without having to reinvent the wheel.
Simply put, we wanted a way for people to create and maintain discussion threads.
Though that is definitely possible on discord, slack, reddit, and plenty of other social media platforms, github was designed for various types of technical discussions and should be a good fit for our purposes.

## How do I add math / LaTeX to github issues?

Github has mathjax support, so feel free to just use mathjax like normal!
It *should* work in most cases.

If you have further questions, please let me know and I'll add them to the list here!
